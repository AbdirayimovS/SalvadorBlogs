What I have learned from the DIVE 2024 Hackathon? 

## Koyilbek's story:
    1. Excitement of working in big hall of more than 400+ people.
        Working in noisy environment where people pass nearby, distract and create a noise
    2. Learned Langchain. How to integrate Langchain with Ollama. Felt taste of the LLM.
    3. Start the project planning and tasks re-direction to each member of a team. 
    4. Unable to express other learned things.
    5. Giving present (small present) to other competitors to show friendliness and kindness. Like giving chocolate, giving advice on certain framework, tool.
    6. 


## Sardor's story
    1. Prepare presentation in the first order. Do not do the presentation after the program is ready.
    2. Be caution of "Bystander effect" delimma with team members
    3. Sleep early at night and wake up and take a walk to beach for a first sunrise. Sunrise is source of enjoyment, and power for a day. 
    4. Do small physical activities with a team like push-ups, handshaking all friends hand and scream to get motivation and power. It is good to sleep and have a professional nap. 
    5. Distraction is the biggest enemy of our progress. I lacked the good requirements and structure. It was very fragile to rely on each other. Each team member must be soft (Flexible enough with its skills to adopt to new requirements and provide robust solution)
    6. Work with URLRequest, MapKit and CoreData
