Today it is boxing day. In the boxing areana there are two stages: stage A and stage B. 
I am sparring on B stage under weight class of 70kg. Currenyly I am 69,50 kg and did not eat well yesterday to keep my weight. 

I have one opponent. Initially my weight class had 4 members. However, two of them are out for some reason. It is amateur boxing therefore I have only 2 rounds and 90 seconds each. 

My strategy: 
1) Keep distance and always move foot. 
2) step go step. Push the opponent keep distance and move. If opponent come close push him. Keep distance. Hit easy not full power. Keep full power for the second round. 
Push opponent
Keep distance 
Keep distance
2) One-two and one-one-two movements. 
3) Right hand and move left hand and go straight or see and go back. Go back prepare for counter-striking. 
4) if the memebr wants to come closer than wait to hit with right hand. Do not wait a lot. Because a round duration is very short. 
5) Keep moving. 
Through hand not the punch.
