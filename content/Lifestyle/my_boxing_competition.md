Summary: About boxing competition

Before my game:
Today it is boxing day. In the boxing areana there are two stages: stage A and stage B.
I am sparring on stage B under weight class of 70kg. Currenyly I am 69,50 kg and did not eat well yesterday to maintain my weight. I have one opponent. Initially my weight class had 4 members. However, two of them are out for some reason. It is amateur boxing therefore I have only 2 rounds and 90 seconds each.

My strategy:
1) Keep distance and always move foot.
2) Push the opponent to keep distance. If opponent come close, push him. Keep distance. Hit easy, not full power. Keep full power for the second round.
3) Use "one-two" and "one-one-two" combinations.
4) Use right hand and move left hand and go straight or watch and go back. Go back prepare for counter-striking.
5) If the opponent wants to come closer than wait to hit with right hand. Do not wait a lot. Because a round duration is very short.
6) Keep moving.

Advice from Lennart: "Throw the hand, not the punch."

After game:
I was in the red corner. My opponent was in the blue corner. Before the match started, I said my favourite oyat from Quran. It kept me peaceful.
First round started very well, expect the middle of the round, when I fall down when wanting to go back to protect myself. Honestly speaking, his hook was very good. I felt tired and lacked strong power in my body. I have tried to start second round fresh. In second round, he was truly dominating over me. The significant mistake I made was moving my head back while keeping my body stationary. The referee paused the game because he thought that I got knockdown. Later on, I got small injury in my left arm while throughing a jab. After another fake knockdown, the referee stopped the game. I officially lose the game.


I did not feel ashamed; my soul was satistified with my body. It was indeed good starting point. To sum up, this experiment with boxing helped me to undertand how I can handle such unusual pressure. It was truly good memory to remember.
