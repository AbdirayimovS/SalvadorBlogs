I wear the orange and pinky T-shirt and go directly to the Gangnam side for start line. I meet new friends and Tim and Bibek.
I was in group D, 10 km was a easy task for me.
It become cooler at that time. Ë‡Therefore I wear training jacket.
The start was given from 42 km runners down to 5km runners. each run was divided into small groups to prevent the traffic jam of people. AS my group slowly progress to the starter line, I was in the first rows to start it. And I started. My earphone in my inner pocker with locked. My phone is in another pocket to create the stability. I started to run fast to reach previous group C. I reached the group C. However due to small road and huge crown I am forced to slow down. The air at first was a bit cold. Then when sun smiled at me, I looked left, it is beautiful yellow garden. I looked right, it is serene Han river. I looked up, it is clean sky and bright sun. I remembered how autumn is wonderful and how I am luckly to be born and feell such feelings. I recitate some sura from Quran and parts of my favurite poems. All of it aded more power and keep runnning to reach my friends group of B. I was surpriced when I pushed more harder, my heart asked for more, and i pushed even harder, however, my heard asked for more. I run first 5 km joyfully. When my friends waved to me from the way back it added even more power. So, I did not even take any breaks, continues on the same tempt back to the starter point, which is both the final line. I do not like the drinking prosedure. I need to practice it or to stop and sit down and drink slowly. Honestly, my body did not required for water, just to satisfy my curiousity I drunk it. I finished the marathon in 55 minutes. To be continues
