Scheduling a day 

Wake up before sunrise
Pray morning prayer 
Go outside and enjoy direct sunlight whenever possible. It will give you literally energy and will get rid of sleepiness. 
Have a great breakfast. Make sure that you will not get hungry before your lunch time. 
Breakfast suggestions:
Oatmeal, nuts, honey, fried or boiled eggs, tea, bread with butter, Jem. Good to have: fresh and hot bread, qaymak. try not touch phone before completing breakfast. 

Make important decisions for a day. Whay you will do and at what time. If you have a meetings, then prepare for them, read your books, read emails, read sunnah and etc. 

If you go work prepare for it. If you go class, prepare class material. What is today topic? What was last week topic. What was the homework. 

Go ahead with confidence in your day. 

Lunch time. 
Start lunch as early as possible. Try to have solid meal. Eat two meals. Eat fruit like apples red apple or banana as desert. Do not use phone during lunch. If possible just turn do no disturb and save some time for walk outside or reading some thing like books or notes. Wash your teeth and take a woodu. Pray the dhuhr within first hour. It is better to do it early. 

After lunch
It is best time for a nap. If possible, take an hour nap, believe me it increase your productivity. If not possible, do the work which does not require too much mental effort. These tasks maybe writing report about your progress with a task or studying the teacher notes. Drafting a prototype. Try to talk to classmates or colleagues to help or ask for a help. If you read the Asr prayer, then the time for sleep is gone. Do tasks like writing down what you did today in work or at school. What is tomorrowâ€™s tasks. Git commit your progress. Try to get thinks professionally done even if they are little. 

Have a small dinner as early as possible. I would recommend to go to sport training in the evening. For men, I suggest combat sports like boxing. Take an evening walks if weather is good. Looking to starts and or full moon shows you how the amazing is the universe. If possible, call parents, write messages to relatives and friends. Do not spend too long time for it. Read Isha prayer at your earliest convenience and brush your teeth carefully and go tight sleep.
