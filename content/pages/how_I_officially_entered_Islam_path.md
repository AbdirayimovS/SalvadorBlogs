It was the end of another Ramandon. I kept maybe 3-5 days of Fasting. It is the end of my freshmen year in Uzbekistan. I study remotely. I do wake up early. Suffer and stay almost alone. Me, my animals, the nature, e-books and lonely sun. 

That times I unsed to build house int he trees. How to survive in the wild. How to know the time in the wild. How to fight with dogs. How to steal apples or cherries. How to do if a snake bites me. 

The quality of education was not satisfactory. I do believe I can get even better information by reading a book instead. I was very angry to my situation. I do not know if I will get the visa eventually? How my father will find 20,000 to put to the bank? How I gonna live without my family? The university is bad, how I can find a job, pay tuition and do part time?  these though were eating me slowly making me dried leave. I used to go to fields be with animals feed them, talj to them, play with neighbor kids and play cards. Do experiments like bulding house, how to protect myself. How to keep the bottle of juice fresh and cold in water just with plants to be as the pipe. 

With such thoughts I went esrly morning with brothers to the Masjid for morning very big pray. The masjid gived me such peace U was looking for whole my life. Especially how people from 7-70 years ild do the same salah together. How the follow the Imam who reads professionally Quran. How people paralel do Salah. How they great each other after salah like pure bright light of sunshine meet each other. After pray we was some lights of star and we bought freah and hot bread for house where my mother, father and sisters were waiting for us and preparing for the guiest come. 
After that day, I talked to God officially and started to go tot he same Masjid every Jumaah. First triels of Salah with errors. I promise Alloh to be better for next Jumah. And so after several Jumaah prayers I was good at it. I used to come to Jumah early even before the Imama and sit in the first rows. I listen to the Imam speech very care and even writing something down to not forget and tell to me parent. The best thing was to make a dua in the end and sometime If I had a money to huy fresh and hot bread even single for me family to make them happy and have a great lunch time together.
