Try to fast twice a week, the best days are Monday and Thursday if you do not do any physical heavy exercise like long running or sparrings. If you are failing to fast twice a week, do heavy sports instead. The best is combining both fasting and sports after work.

Somedays call or text to grandparents if they alive.

Read Quran someday.

Plan your weekends already for two weeks ahead or a month ahead. What would you do in weekends. Who would you meet? What would you do? Use Saturday as the most productive day as possible. Read your favorite books or new research articles, practice new things and do experiments, write down what is in your mind. If possible go and eat your favorite food even if it is expensive. 
Sunday, you may rest a little longer to have a longer afternoon nap. If you are not having good sleep during week days, sleep the sunday afternoon to get that sleeping plan done. Sunday is very good day to meet with friends, people, colleagues, do social activities. However go sleep on sunday early possible.
