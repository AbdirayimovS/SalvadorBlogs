It is 25th December, I am going home. From my family nobody knows. 

I come unexpectedly I managed to buy even a flower for my mother. 


She cried and hugged my for a long time in a cold weather. People around us very surprised. 

I see the old and chaos structure and unproductive and uncolorfulness, slowness and lack of care in streets. People are angry and frustrated. Everyone hurry for something. Saying bad words. Not controlled own feelings. Not honest. 
Meet with friends. Meet my teacher Robiya opa. It was one of the best thing I did. It still remains in my brain: Uzbeks click his eyes like bird his own eyes. He is such stupid. When he will wake up. I told her than Korea in like 20 or 30 years ahead. 

New year party. Poetry party with relative. Almost many youns are married. Happy for them. 
Went to village. House become old. People are thinking about the weddings, doing to work to make money, entertainment, social media and food of course. 


Missed Korea. 
Went to Qaqnus TV shou with my lovely sisters
Meet lyceum friends. Enjoyed talking to them a lot. 

Prayed Alloh asked only from Alloh. 
Next day at 10:00 am leave house and go to airport and entered. I remebr how my father called the admin to allow him to enter. I told them it si okay no need for it. I said them bye. The security did not allows because there were cause in the airport. 
I cried and feed sad. I entered the plane. I am very sad going away from family. The plane turns on engine, my heart beats weavy, the plane move to the flying road, the weaking temp increase. The plane starts to move increasingly fast, I my heart is beating in the same exponential speed as the plane. The small drops of water appeared in my eyes. The plane take of the ground. The flow of water comes from my eyes. I promised myself and asked only from Alloh that next time when I come back Tashkent I can make better change better life for my fsmily for my grandparetn for my relatibes for my friends. I took my handcuffs and took of the salty waters. I am ready for next adventure. Bismillah. 

Cried silently.
