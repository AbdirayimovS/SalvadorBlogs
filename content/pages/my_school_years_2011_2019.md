1st Grade:
 Shy, Dedicated, Do not know russian language well, try to follow others. Huge struggle with poems. Love with math. One clever guy, I wanted to be better than him. Because of bad toilet I waited till I go home. But I failed the nature was stronger and I pissed off in my entrance to my house right after ringing the doorbell. I believe doorbell gaved me sense of security. Nobody knew the a Russian in my family. 2011
 
 2nd Grade: Migration to new school. New adoptation, struggle again, a little bit not strickt. Good adoptation. Karate and snowy days. Karate was funner. Mother cooked meals from local meal cooking school. 2012
 
 3rd Grade: Migration to previous school. Again new adoptation. A big struggle with Russian language and russian dictation exams. Girls did very good job. I blame myself a lot. Rushing to be the best. Except russian and literature, I did homeworks on time read the homeworks and be ready for next lessons. I was in the top. I enjoyed them. When it comes to Russian language exams, my results are bad and my teacher seeing my efforts tried to give me 4-, instead of 3. At that time the best mark was 5, the worth was 2. I had such mind that if I got 2 mark I am the dumbest person. It is like big shame. I played game with my brother who gets more 5 marks in a week. I rush to get the 5 marks and win the competition. In the end of the year, I eventually win it. My mother did hard work to find me extra tutors to master my Russian. When it comes to the poems. I see them as math formula and read them as fast as possibly. 2013
 
 4th Grade: In summer, I studied math, the math and its exams were very funny for me. I could solve them instantly and submit my work as first man. The thing to do anything first is develop from then. Love to Farangiz and my shame on bad speaking the russian. I clearly remember how she was smart and maybe smarter than me, except math. She did very good job with Russian. 
 I barely speak Russian and even Uzbek. I mostly spend time watching classmates playing that times best game Subway surf or preparing for exams. I was excellent time manager and homework manager. I did homeworks right after the class finishs and it it was time consuming I would do it right after the meal when I get to home. I hate to not be responsible. I remember I even cried when I wake up late for the school. Later understood that it is not only me but my whole family. English learning and seeing Farangiz there too. She was much better than me. I felt shy and awkward. She finally surprised me in summer that year when she danced an amazing dance. I did not expect such amazing performance. Since that time, I have not had a chance to see her. Even get her contact number. I was very proud to be able to solve higher class math easily. My teacher told me at last time. Sardor, keep studying, but be careful to not be ill with star ills. 2014
 
 5th Grade: Seperation of Farangiz, other students, enjoing two classes into big class. Had been bullied even if I went to Taekwondo. At that time In my mind was the idea that I might kill the another person badly, and let him to bully me. The class was bad tempered. During exams student asked from me for answers some politely and some with bullying. I have tried to manage it. I tried to stay positive and be quite. 
I felt alone. I remeber how one day my small nut of the pumpkin I put to the flower plant was born. The first plan I am growing. I feels very good sensation at that time. Finally I sleep at night freely without any supplementaries. I used to had wet dreams. Movies, math books, hated literature books, they did no fit me.  2015

 6th Grade: Love to Oksana. She was pretty. Seemed for me funny. Yet I did not talked to her. Hello physics. 
 English is tough. Why other subjects does not follow the rules of math:((
 Should It be like it?
 I hated essays because ai did not have enough vocabulary to express my deepest feelings both in russian and uzbek. I felt very bad. My brain mostly thought the word like numbers and numbers. English learning. 
 I was the guys who knows the entire math at that time. No other student would jo contest with me. I was very proud of my math skill. 2016
 
 7th Grade: Understanding the environment. Rubiks cube. The record and dedication towards it. Running in the morning and sometimes doing rubic cube with friends. Bullying stopped, but yet some continued to do small bullying which I believe doesnâ€™t affect me but it affects them. I had such habits of not saying any bad words and not visiting the men toilet. The men toilet was like house of pigs, the bathroom in PI class was another pigs house. Swimming not Taekwonda. English learning. No time for other things. My height was not high enough. I did not eat lunch and eat after the school. The pressure I am having on myself. Still I am not friend with Russian language. I did not get even some their jokes and I was not the guy to do small bad things at class. Start of addiction to bad content. My math skills does not make a huge difference it was on the same level and might be slightly better, not not exponentially better. 2017
 
 8th Grade: Class is almost grown up. Pupils knows each other very well. Who comes to study who comes to have a fun and who comes because of law. Going to English, Math is feeling not fun. Yet ai managed to be the first pupil. Yet no my own smartphone. Eager and dreamed of what I will install and what I will use for. Who wants to become who? What is their goal? 
 My goal at that time is to become great economist. The guys to control the flow of money in the country and open own bank. But then it changed to become president 2018
 
 9th Grade:  Prepareting to lyceum. Moved from Tashkent to Qibray. Going to school at 6:50 am and coming home later at 20:00. Bad lunchs. Taking walk from Qorasu to Inha university to study English. Or go to Robiya opa house for free math advanced classes. Attend mathematics institute to go there to one great teacher. Applied to President school, Lyceum of Gubkin, Westminister lyceum. Felt very bad when I found that I did not enter the President school. I felt even more bad when I lacked some points to enter the Westminister. I am thinking that there are many more talented persons than me. I am misirible and yet all my struggles and effort went to nothing. Expect the Russian language exams results, I got all other subjects ideally A+. I entered the Gubkin yes. The trust to myself falled down. But its was not that high reputation as others. I kept talking with Aziz, Saidislom, Xasan Xusan and Shokhruh. 
I used to day female classfriends what there is one girl who does not know that is Instagram and social media. Who is pure waiting for me in my village. 
 
 Overall, I would say my school years were pretty challenging and yet I failed to speak fluently in Russian. My school years ended with the idea that I am weak even if I struggle and do so much efford I could not continue education in the prestigious luceum of Tashkent. Yet I was busy with IELTS and other thought. Living isolated from friends moved to Qibray to new village where it is very dark. It is another story. 2019
