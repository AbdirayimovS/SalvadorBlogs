How I develop the hoppy to send small Ehson money each week on Friday Jumaah. 
The money is not big but they are small. They reminds me of the poority, financial challenges people are facing and more. It makes me to remind the death and my times when I could not afford to buy good lunch and my family was not financially stable to give me money to school. I sometimes eat hot bread, or rarely bring food from home. They were not enough for me that time. I managed somehow to buy one cooked sausage or pigodi. I did not like that the break time is just 15 minutes long. Why it is not long enough to have a good and solid food. 

I got 50,000 won from my professor for my birthday. It is was a proof of the Ehsan. So I can buy for that money new books and continue steadily to do ehsan. More proofreading is required.
